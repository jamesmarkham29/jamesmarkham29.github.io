    <h2> Breakdancing</h2>
<p>Breakdancing, also known as breaking, is a vibrant street dance style that blends rhythmic footwork, acrobatic spins, and dramatic freezes. It first appeared in the South Bronx of New York City during the early 1970s, created by African American and Puerto Rican youth as part of the emerging hip-hop culture. Over time, it grew into a global art form, symbolizing creativity, resilience, and community expression.</p>
 <h2>Mountian Biking</h2>
 <p>Mountain biking is the sport of riding specially designed bicycles across rugged, off-road terrain. With features like suspension systems and wide tires, these bikes are built to handle trails, hills, and rocky paths. The sport originated in California in the late 1970s, particularly in Marin County, where adventurous riders modified cruiser bikes to withstand rough trails. Today, mountain biking has expanded into multiple disciplines, from cross-country racing to downhill and freeride adventures.
 <h2>Mixed Martial Arts</h2>
 <p>Mixed Martial Arts is a full-contact combat sport that combines striking and grappling techniques from disciplines such as boxing, wrestling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and judo. Its roots can be traced to early 20th-century contests in Japan and Brazil’s “vale tudo” fights, which allowed nearly any fighting style. The modern version gained worldwide recognition in the 1990s with the rise of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), transforming MMA into one of the fastest-growing sports globally.</p>
