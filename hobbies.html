    <h2>Bass Guitar</h2>
    <P>The bass guitar is a stringed instrument that provides the low-end rhythm and harmony in most modern music. Typically with four strings tuned an octave lower than a standard guitar, it anchors the groove alongside drums. The electric bass guitar was developed in the 1950s, most notably by Leo Fender, whose Precision Bass became the first widely adopted model. Since then, the bass has been central to genres ranging from rock and funk to jazz and pop.</P>
    <h2>Running</h2>
    <p>Running is a form of locomotion and exercise where a person moves rapidly on foot, faster than walking, by propelling themselves forward in strides. It is one of the most natural human activities, practiced for survival, travel, and sport throughout history. Organized running as a competitive sport dates back to the ancient Olympic Games in Greece around 776 BCE, where footraces were among the earliest events. Today, running is both a recreational activity and a global sport, with marathons and track events drawing millions of participants.</p>
    <h2>Weight Lifting</h2>
    <p>Weight lifting is a form of strength training that involves lifting free weights, barbells, or using resistance machines to build muscle, increase power, and improve overall fitness. It emphasizes progressive overload—gradually increasing the weight or resistance to challenge the body and stimulate growth. The practice has ancient roots, with evidence of stone lifting in ancient Greece, Egypt, and China, where it was used both for sport and military training. Modern weight lifting as a competitive discipline developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, eventually becoming an Olympic sport in 1896. Today, it is both a professional sport and a popular fitness activity worldwide, forming the foundation of bodybuilding, powerlifting, and general strength training.</p>
